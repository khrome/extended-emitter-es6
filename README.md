extended-emitter-es6
====================

A port of [extended-emitter](https://github.com/khrome/extended-emitter) to an external module so I can make something mocha testable in node without recompilation.

At some point in the future this code will be reunified as soon as import, require, AMD, commonjs and browser globals can all be accomodated in a single file without transpile.
